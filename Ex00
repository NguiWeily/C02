• Reproduce the behavior of the function strcpy (man strcpy).
• Here’s how it should be prototyped :
char *ft_strcpy(char *dest, char *src);

Certainly! Here's an implementation of the `ft_strcpy` function that reproduces the behavior of the `strcpy` function:

```c
char *ft_strcpy(char *dest, char *src)
{
    char *dest_start = dest;
    
    while (*src)
    {
        *dest = *src;
        dest++;
        src++;
    }
    
    *dest = '\0';  // Add null terminator at the end
    
    return dest_start;
}
```

In this implementation, the `ft_strcpy` function takes two parameters: `dest`, which is a pointer to the destination string, and `src`, which is a pointer to the source string. It copies the characters from the source string to the destination string until it encounters a null character (`'\0'`), indicating the end of the source string. After copying all the characters, it adds a null terminator at the end of the destination string.

Finally, it returns a pointer to the beginning of the destination string (`dest_start`).

Please note that this implementation assumes that the destination string `dest` has enough space to accommodate the characters from the source string `src`.
